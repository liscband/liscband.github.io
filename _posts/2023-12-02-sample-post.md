Blocks of code can be done like below (just for thoroughness)

```javascript
function javascriptCodeIWroteALongTimeAgo() {
    var blah = document.getElementsByClassName('doubleBlah');

    if (styleChanger.value == 'blah') {
        return 'agreed';
    } 
    else if (styleChanger.value == 'asd;flkj') {
        return '???';
    }
    else {
        'yes';
    }
}
```

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
